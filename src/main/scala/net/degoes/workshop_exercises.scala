 * INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP - BUILD A RECIPE COMPOSER
 *
 * In this exercise, you'll build a functional domain for composing cooking recipes!
 * This will teach you the three pillars of Functional Design:
 *   1. MODELS (immutable data types)
 *   2. CONSTRUCTORS (building simple solutions)
 *   3. OPERATORS (transforming and combining solutions)
 *
 * You'll work through 3 progressive levels, with each level building on the previous one.

 * ============================================================================
 * REFLECTION QUESTIONS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * After completing these exercises, think about:
 *
 * 1. COMPOSABILITY:
 *    - Why do operators return the same type (Recipe)?
 *    - What does this let you do?
 *
 * 2. IMMUTABILITY:
 *    - Are you modifying existing recipes or creating new ones?
 *    - What are the benefits of this approach?
 *
 * 3. EXPRESSIVENESS:
 *    - Look at your `chocolateChipCookiesWithFrosting` implementation
 *    - Is it readable? Does it look like a "recipe DSL"?
 *
 * 4. ORTHOGONALITY:
 *    - Do your operators overlap in functionality?
 *    - Could you build `scale` from other operators?
 *    - What's the minimal set of operators you really need?
 *
 * These questions preview the advanced topics in modules 05-07!
